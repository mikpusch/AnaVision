# AnaVision
FLIM/FRET and other image analysis

AnaVision was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

Download the source-folder and use the project file "AnaVision.vcxproj" found in the AnaVision folder to load the project into VisualStudio.

The only adjustment to be made is the following: Replace "Complex.h" in the include folder of Visual Studio by the file "Complex.h" file in the github source folder.
